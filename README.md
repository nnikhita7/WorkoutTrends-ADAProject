# WorkoutTrends-ADAProject      



## Overview
When visiting a gym, the variety of exercises available is striking, from bodyweight movements to machine-based and dumbbell/barbell exercises. With so many choices, both beginners and experienced gym-goers may wonder which exercises best target specific muscles. This project analyzes a dataset of strength-based exercises for muscle groups like the abdominal muscles, chest, biceps, adductors, glutes, forearms, and lower back, and so on. The dataset includes details about exercise type and fitness level. This analysis aims to help individuals choose effective workouts for their fitness goals, especially as interest in fitness has grown since the pandemic.

## Dataset Source: 
I obtained my dataset from Kaggle   [GYM_Excercise](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/gym-exercise-data?resource=download)


## Dataset Highlights:

#### Exercise Type: Strength workouts targeting various muscle groups.
#### Equipment: Includes gym equipment like barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, and more.
#### Fitness Level: Exercises categorized as beginner or intermediate to fit different experiences.
#### Rating: Each exercise is rated for effectiveness and difficulty, making it easier to find beneficial workouts.


## Personal Connection: 
The dataset caught my interest because, after the pandemic, everyone, including myself, became more focused on fitness. I love working out, and this data can help identify the best exercises for reaching specific fitness goals. Additionally, visualizing the exercise details would provide a fun and engaging way to understand workout options.


## Goal:
To discover the most effective exercises for various fitness goals across different muscle groups, understand workout trends, and provide engaging visualizations that assist users in selecting exercises tailored to their fitness aspirations.

## Using R for Interactive Analysis
I used R to clean and organise the data. I created an inteactive report with R MArkdown that shows the analysis and graphs together. This makes it easy for users to explore the insights.
